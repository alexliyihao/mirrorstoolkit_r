# Mirrorstoolkit in R

## What

Welcome to Mirrorstoolkit (in R)! It is a collection for data analyses deployed in my research works. I abstracted and wrapped them from my previous projects for those implementations which are either:

 - Frequently deployed.
 - A bit wordy in the implementation.
 - Might be deployed again in future project.
 - Very R: I'm a pythonic person, my practice is very seaborn-like.

## Why

This is majorly for my personal usage (thus it won't be on CRAN). But I'll keep it maintained here.

## Who

If you are:
 - Biomed person who need a basic stat wrappers (and your supervisor won't check your code XD).
 - As what I mentioned, python Pandas person.
I hope it can make your life easier.

## Where

The environment is in DESCRIPTION.

I'm using a Macbook 2016 with macOS Monterey 12.7.6. Running R 4.4.0 with tidyverse family. I'll make sure all the packages I used is based on CRAN.

## When

I'll keep growing this one. Along with its Python counterpart (Planned).

## How

```
devtools::install_github("alexliyihao/mirrorstoolkit_r")
library(mirrorstoolkit)
```
